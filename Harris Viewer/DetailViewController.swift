    // we need to use the image view inside code by creating a property that is attached to the layout
    // hover over the grey circle to the left
    // IBOutlet: there is a connection between this code and Interface Builder
    // weak: don't own this object in memory, the view owns it
    // imageView: the property name assigned to this UIIMageView
    // UIImageView!: declares property to be of type UIImageView, and then implicitly unwrapped
